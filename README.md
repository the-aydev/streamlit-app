'The earth is what we all have in common', a quote by Wendell Berry. This project leverages on AI and MapBox APi to locate, detect and quantify plastic debris in our oceans.

It's very important because it can be used to  monitor the garbage dump, locate highly polluted areas to clear them and save sea animal lives.

**Problem:**
No proper monitoring and detection system of plastic debris in the oceans

**Solution:**
A web app that leverages on GIS systems to locate, detect and quantify plastic debris in the oceans.
