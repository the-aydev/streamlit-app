A web app that uses GIS to allow a scientist to locate an ocean on the map, takes a screenshot of the map and sends it to the AI which shows the areas containing plastic. Our solution leverages on AI to quantify and classify the amount of debris into three parts

1. Plastic (one plastic)
2. Nylon (Large or small floating nylons on the surface)
3. Group_Plastic (This is a large plastic containing as many as 10 to more than 100 plastics together in a place)
The model returns an image showing the affected areas and the location.

It's very important because it can be used to  monitor the garbage dump, locate highly polluted areas to  clear them and save sea animal lives.
